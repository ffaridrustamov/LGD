The work starts with exploratory data analysis — descriptive statistics, null checks, and boxplots for each numeric feature. Outliers are handled using IQR-based capping (Winsorization). Two new features are then engineered: the mean income per region and the mean number of previous defaults per credit score group.
Before modeling, a KS test is run to check normality, followed by Spearman correlation analysis to identify which features are meaningfully related to LGD%. A VIF analysis is also performed to detect and address multicollinearity. Categorical variables are encoded with one-hot encoding, features are scaled using StandardScaler, and the data is split 80/20 for training and testing.
Two Linear Regression models are built. The first uses all selected features and is evaluated with MAE, MSE, RMSE, R², and Adjusted R². The second runs each feature independently to rank them by Test R². Based on this, the final model is trained on the top 5 features: Employment History, Previous Defaults, Loan Term, Debt to Income Ratio, and Income.
In the deployment stage, a new dataset (lgd_data_deploy.xlsx) goes through the same feature engineering and scaling pipeline before predictions are generated with the trained model.
